# Tell me yelp, where should I eat out?!(still looking for a cool name!)
yelp is an online platform which provides information about businesses. Here, I build a recommendation system to predict a list of certain businesses, i.e., restaurants for users to dine out. This recommendation is based on QUICK EXPLANATION OF RECSYS ALGO!.


# Introduction & Goals
The primary objective of this project is to build a recommendation engine which can be useful for platform users (service demanders) and business owners (service suppliers). The visitors can benefit from such recommendation system by learning about the potential services to select while the business owners can get an insight what yelp may suggest the visitors as their potential competitors.

# The Dataset
The dataset I utilized in this project comes from https://www.yelp.com/dataset which provides a subsample of yelp data for educational purposes. I have accessed to the February, 2020 version of the dataset on the yelp platform. <br>
The data geographically covers some states of United States and some providences of Canada. The dataset includes different types of businesses from restaurants to beauty salons. In this project, my focus is on *restaurants* which consists one-third of the businesses.
This dataset consists of different json files to cover an overview of businesses, checkin information for businesses, customer reviews, tips, and user reviews. To get insights from different json pieces, I merged the datasets and used it as the final dataset.<br>
I chose yelp dataset because analyzing user-behavior dataset can generate valuable analytical-based solution for business problems. **work in progressThis dataset includes timestamped information which can be useful for visualization purposes (which I used to do CERTAIN VISUALIZATION FOR UI). The categorical features in the dataset ease data filtering task.**
### The potential roadblocks in this dataset are... 
### What do you want to do with it? Using Collaborative Filtering (probably computationally expensive, i.e. what products similar users liked) or Content-based filtering (i.e. previous likes of a user, and keywords)
