# Title Of Your Project
Add a catchy title to your project. Something that people immediately know what you are doing

# Introduction & Goals
The primary objective of this project is to build a recommendation engine which can be useful for platform visitors (service demanders, any better term?) and business owners (service suppliers). The visitors can benefit from such recommendation system by learning about the potential services to select while the business owners can get an insight what yelp may suggest the visitors as their potential competitors.

# The Data Set
The dataset I utilized in this project comes from https://www.yelp.com/dataset which provides a subsample of yelp data for educational purposes. This dataset is in json format and includes different json files to cover an overview of businesses, checkin information for businesses, customer reviews, tips, and visitors reviews.
I chose yelp dataset because analyzing user behavior dataset it reflects user behaviors and ? Also, this datasets includes timestamped information which can be useful for visualization purposes (which I used to do CERTAIN VISUALIZATION FOR UI). The categorical features in the dataset ease data filtering task.
### The potential roadblocks in this dataset are...
